          I am a dedicated fourth-year Computer Engineering student at the
          Polytechnic University of Timișoara, specializing in
          <br />
          full-stack web development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Through personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in both
          frontend and backend development, where I've worked with technologies
          like React for building dynamic interfaces and Spring Boot, ASP.NET
          Core, and Node.js for backend services. I've also utilized databases
          like MySQL and PostgreSQL to manage data effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          My focus on user experience, clean code, and scalable architecture
          drives my approach to creating responsive, engaging, and efficient web
          applications.
